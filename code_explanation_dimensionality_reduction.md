# Code Explanation: Dimensionality Reduction for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

This document provides a thorough explanation of the code and methodology used in the project, focusing on dimensionality reduction techniques and their impact on model performance.

---

## **1. Dataset Splitting**
- The dataset was split into **80% training data** and **20% test data** using `train_test_split` from `scikit-learn` with `random_state=42` for reproducibility.
- **Training Data** (\(X_{\text{train}}\), \(y_{\text{train}}\)): Used to train models.
- **Test Data** (\(X_{\text{test}}\), \(y_{\text{test}}\)): Used to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

---

## **2. Baseline Model**
- **Objective**: Establish a benchmark for performance using all 30 features.
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier.
- **Results**:
  - Accuracy: **96%**
  - Precision, recall, and F1-score indicate excellent performance for both benign and malignant classes.

---

## **3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Objective**: Reduce the number of dimensions while retaining 95% of the variance.
- **Steps**:
  1. Standardized the features to have zero mean and unit variance.
  2. Applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality.
  3. Trained a Random Forest model on the PCA-reduced dataset.
- **Results**:
  - Accuracy: **95%**
  - Slightly lower recall for the malignant class compared to the baseline.

## **4. Feature Selection**
- **Objective**: Identify the most predictive features using Random Forest feature importance scores.
- **Steps**:
  1. Ranked features based on importance scores from the baseline model.
  2. Selected the top 10 most important features.
  3. Trained a Random Forest model using only these selected features.
- **Results**:
  - Accuracy: **96%**
  - Matches the baseline, confirming that the top 10 features contain most of the predictive information.

---

## **5. Generalization and Comparison**
- **Generalization**:
  - The test accuracy closely matches the training accuracy, indicating good generalization.
  - Regularization and ensemble techniques (Random Forest) prevent overfitting.
- **Comparison**:
  - **Baseline**: Best performance but uses all 30 features.
  - **PCA**: Slightly lower accuracy but computationally efficient.
  - **Feature Selection**: Matches baseline accuracy with fewer features, making it the best choice for compact models.

---

## **6. Visualizations**
- **Feature Importance**:
  - Bar plot showing the top 10 features ranked by importance scores.
- **PCA Variance Explained**:
  - Plot illustrating how much variance is retained by each principal component.

---

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates that dimensionality reduction can create compact and efficient diagnostic models:
1. PCA reduces dimensionality with a minimal trade-off in accuracy.
2. Feature selection identifies the most critical predictors, achieving baseline performance with only 10 features.
